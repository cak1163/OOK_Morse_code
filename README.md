## On-Off Keying and Morse Code Detection
On-off keying, specifically binary amplitude-shift keying, is a type of digital modulation in which the carrier wave amplitude is varied between two levels to represent binary values "0" or "1." During transmission, a "1" is represented by sending a carrier wave at a fixed amplitude, while a "0" is represented by the absence of a carrier wave, resulting in a transmitted signal that is "on" or "off" according to an incoming data stream.
